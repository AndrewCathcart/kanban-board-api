## Description

This repo contains the backend code for a todo app that I've made for fun in order practice;

- [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
- testing
- docker & docker-compose
- microservice oriented architecture
- CI & CD

## Installation

Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required. This can be installed via the website or by using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (see their documentation).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for local development.

Then install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ docker-compose up --build
```
