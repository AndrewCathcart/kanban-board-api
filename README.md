# nestjs-todo [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/AndrewCathcart/nestjs-todo.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/AndrewCathcart/nestjs-todo)

## Description

Wanted to get to grips with using [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) - this repo contains the backend code for a simple todo app that I've made for fun!

## Installation

Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required. This can be installed via the website or by using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (see their documentation).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for local development.

Then install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ docker-compose up --build
```
